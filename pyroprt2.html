little twit, pay attention, we're under fire!!!&rdquo; Mustafa was
crying towards me. I was drifting when I was supposed to be their
marksman. &ldquo;Blue dragoon at 12 o'clock and incoming at 11 &amp;
1 as well.&rdquo; I shouted, looked down my cross-hairs and tapped a
bullet a time. I was drifting because  I forgot the guys cannot see
the enemy through their thermo-optic camouflage as I can. They need
to use special ultra-violet visors which hurt their skulls because of
the headache, throbbing outside from the brain. Jacques rolled down a
fuel barrel towards the enemy direction and shot it with his pistol
through the wall, it ricocheted like a pool cue ball and into the
fuel barrel which exploded.</SPAN></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">Mustafa threw
a flash-bang grenade and shot two more &ldquo;green dragoons&rdquo;.
They claim their hue is really green, what I see as blue. Afterwards
Jacques started to give short bursts of fire from his B-56. An ugly
yet cute weapon much like the boys in its traits.</SPAN></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">	&ldquo;Stop
firing, Jacques, the hallway is clear.&rdquo; Mustafa ordered after a
two minute sweep with the ultra-violet visor. They turned the visors
off. I was glad for a moment to see their faces; Mustafa sent his arm
as if to pat my back at first (or at least it seemed that way in
first glance) but after a second he had thrust me against the wall by
my neck.</SPAN></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">	&ldquo;Next
time when you're day-dreaming in the middle of a fire fight I'll put
a bullet through your head, Ophelia, got it?&rdquo; He was choking
me, I was trying to get out of his strangling grip and wanted to
shoot him myself but I knew what would be his next sentence: &ldquo;I
have a wife and child at home.&rdquo;</SPAN></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">	&ldquo;Leave

up, you think I don't know how much you care for her, but I'll kill
her if she drifts again... if you get my drift...&rdquo; He added
with a wicked smile, and was looking at my eyes and I was trying to
avert my eyes from him, though he wouldn't let me, pointing my head
towards his exo skeletal arm.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">	&ldquo;Listen,
man, I care for her dearly, but even I would kill her on her next
day-dreaming in a fire fight, but come on, man, this was her first
baptism into real combat, much like I was not prepared at first but
your firing awoke the adrenaline in me.&rdquo; I wanted to kill
Jacques too for what he said but then I realized the halls could be
swarming with those dragoons, the simulations could not prepare us
good enough.</SPAN></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">	The armour
could sustain two bullets at a specific place, any third bullet would
surely penetrate. The enemy uses tri-round bursts, but they are
unable to maintain their firing range into the same spot thrice, most
of the time, that is. You couldn't die in a simulation, you would
simply re-spawn, but in real life there is no re-spawning.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">	All of a
sudden a new six blue dragoons emerged from a dark and silent corner.
The sound of silence was the worst sound effect of all, how could
they sneak up on us like that. Our guns were not yet reloaded and we
were outnumbered 2 to 1. &ldquo;Six blue dragoons 2 o'clock&rdquo; I
whispered to Mustafa and Jacques. &ldquo;Polar bears&rdquo; Mustafa
said and they turned into polar bears while I changed into a wolf,
apparently I forgot to reset my DNA transformer. The bears dealt with
five dragoons. I jumped on the sixth with a powerful pounce. My claws
tore its flesh but he shot me five times before hand. Luckily, when
we returned to human form we were still unhurt. Mustafa took out his
clip and refilled it with bullets. Afterwards it was my turn to be
non-perceptive to a fight, though as the marksman I must be alert at
any given moment. The thought of eliminating them crosses my mind
again. Mustafa got a wife and child waiting at home. It wouldn't be
right. It goes against the chain of command, he's my sergeant.
Jacques could well deserve it, not for seeing me naked, I knew he was
camouflaged, I knew what he was doing there beside watching, but
enjoyed the pretence of innocence of my part as well. Fuck it, I'll
blame it all on those &ldquo;green dragoons&rdquo;. </SPAN></FONT>
