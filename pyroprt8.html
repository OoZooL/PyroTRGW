an amorphous bubble, protected by a continent-sized dome, rising to
26 km at some points. The dome has its own artificial ozone layer.
Inside the dome there is a cytoplasm bubble enclosed within a
membrane which is sensitive to salt water. The membrane outer side is
hydrophobic and the inner side is hydrophilic. The dome's cytoplasm
is being fed by micro-organism filled tubes. They are auto-tropic
phytoplankton which generates glucose by micro-bulbs through
photo-synthesis. The side effect of the former process is also the
release of oxygen into the mixture of fluids in the form of tiny
bubbles. Vitamins are produced by micro-organisms such as E. Colli
and other transmuted plasmidic engineered bacteria.&rdquo;</SPAN></FONT></P>

their genome has limited the creation of recessive traits such as
phenotypes of eye colour, hair colour, multi-allele traits such as 
height, weight, breast size in females, facial hair in males and so
