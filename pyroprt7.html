<P LANG="zh-CN" DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-US">	&quot;Hideo, have you ever heard of the biggest
commercial corporation in the known universe, a.k.a Microsoft?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P LANG="zh-CN" DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-US">	&quot;Maybe a little, they were almost the only
companies who stood against the Free Software Foundation and the Open
Source front, right?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P LANG="zh-CN" DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-US">	&quot;Exactly.&quot; Exclaimed Ishikawa in
enthusiasm. &quot;Once hardware manufacturers like AMD-ATI and nVidia
started to co-operate fully with Linux distributions worldwide, it
was just a question of time, until Microsoft will perish. Once both
gaming and scientific applications could be easily ported into the
free &amp; open source OS of Linux / Unix both Apple and Microsoft,
rivals from the proprietary OS started to wither.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P LANG="zh-CN" DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-US">	&quot;Why is that?&quot; Hideo wondered.</SPAN></P>
<P LANG="zh-CN" DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-US">	&quot;Because what would you prefer: A paid-for
OS which is unstable and closed sourced or a free OS, which is more
stable &amp; open-sourced?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P LANG="zh-CN" DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-US">	&quot;Basically I'll take the free one if it's
better in every aspect of it over the paid one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P LANG="zh-CN" DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-US">	&quot;Thus in 2020 Apple went bankrupt and in
2025 Microsoft died.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P LANG="zh-CN" DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-US">	&quot;What is the moral of the story?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P LANG="zh-CN" DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-US">	&quot;The freedom of choice. Kalistor doesn't
force people to join his group, they choose to do so. Although the
hive was designed after a similar concept of the Matrix Trilogy,
people were given full freedom whether they want to be inserted to
the hive or not. But eventually Kalistor managed to convince people
they live in a bubble, or in a lie. Their life has become based on
Residual Self Image and private places were no longer private where
anyone can sense the stream of consciousness of virtually any
thought. This is the neural energy of the orgy of the cerebral core,
the source of infinite orgasms without breaking catholic code of
behaviour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P LANG="zh-CN" DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-US">	&quot;But it's usually a punishment to be
extracted from the hive, the mind cannot sustain the quietness, and
the disconnection of thoughts. How can he manage to get people from
the hive?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P LANG="zh-CN" DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-US">	&quot;He has his own extraction points, no doubt,
and his disciples choose to be extracted and sometimes they are
allowed to return to the hive through his insertion points as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P LANG="zh-CN" DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-US">	&quot;So basically he can exocytose and
endocytose brains as he pleases. What's the military view on the
matter?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P LANG="zh-CN" DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-US">	&quot;It's complicated since some of them are
outlaws and some just extreme fanatics who believe in the existence
of hell and Kalistor is Satan's right hand or something like this.
It's hard to outlaw an entire religion, though the terrorists are
being chased after all the time.&quot;  </SPAN>
