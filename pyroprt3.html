at those ever-green yellow blade meadows again... The sky is
darkening, some lightning bolts are striking the land, scorching the
earth wherever they hit... Run you foolish boy, start running
already, he lingers for a few more seconds before turning around and
starts heading for cover. At the sky some enemy vessels have decided
to give chase of their new found prey. Those vultures are after you,
with their stupid octagonal shaped wings, clearly not built in an
aero-dynamic thinking, probably their architect intended them for
space <SPAN LANG="en-US">flight</SPAN> only... Using rather powerful
engines they are quite fast as well in the atmosphere, not as our
F-512-XAs but still, run foolish boy, give them a hard time, get to
the cover of the nearby buildings, or more correctly whatever left of
them, they'll never find you in those ruins... Fuck what is it?

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">	Sixteen hours
later the commodore whispered to me &ldquo;Wake up beautiful...&rdquo;
I heard it, when they woke me up using their serums. I was in the
embryonic chamber, semi floating, semi standing in about 60 degrees
stance, inside a diagonally standing human size testing tube.
Hydro-oxygen rich fluid filling my lungs. Great I was naked again, as
if female nudity is really necessary to the resurrection process,
those god damn pervert scientists. The commodore looks at me,
admiring my cursed figure of genetical engineering brought to the
level of perfection. Breasts size according to the parents wish. They
settled on C36, midway before I was even born. Quite a threat on the
reproduction rate for other girls around me. Coal black wavy long
hair. My parents a Swede and a Dane, both blonde, a recessive trait,
as if I wouldn't know I'm adopted, once I learn basic rules of
inheritance.  How I turned out to be  a drifter to a couple of nomads
in Europe. They smoked weed all day and drank beer all night, but I
never wanted to to turn out the way they were. <SPAN LANG="en-US">I
was destined for great impact on the human race, maybe, probably not,
delusions of self grandeur are common nowadays, aren't them...?</SPAN></SPAN></FONT></P>

in the complex, never made it back to the Oedipus, or to the
Antigone. I guess one mother ship is as good as another, hexagon
corridors made of carbine poly-alloy, somewhere between black and
grey, though tends slightly more into dark grey in general. The
complex corridors are hexagonal as well but wider, much like the
Antigone embryonic chambers are slightly smaller than those of the
complex with an annoying 45 degrees stance, where you cannot sleep or
move until it phases into a bubble membrane and you can exocytose out
of it.</SPAN></FONT></P>

stalling, I want to hear explanations and I want them now.&rdquo; The

wicked smile almost escapes to an actual manifestation but withheld
on the last second.</SPAN></FONT></P>
