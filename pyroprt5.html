<SPAN LANG="en-GB">The Commodore just passed with Mr. Ravenloft and
the new courier boy with yet another supply freight of medical
supplies. They entered into the Commodore office.</SPAN></P>
<P DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.65cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-GB">&quot;What's going on there?&rdquo; Mustafa asked.</SPAN></P>
<P DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.65cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-GB">&quot;The usual, first business, then pleasure.&rdquo;
Jacques replied.</SPAN></P>
<P DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.65cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-GB">&quot;This is not necessarily the order when it
comes to the Commodore.&rdquo; Ophelia said.</SPAN></P>
<P DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.65cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-GB">&quot;What do you mean?&rdquo;</SPAN></P>
<P DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.65cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-GB">&quot;He and Mr. Ravenloft, haven't you noticed
there's always another courier boy or girl, from core planet?&rdquo;</SPAN></P>
<P DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.65cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-GB">&quot;so?&rdquo;</SPAN></P>
<P DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.65cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-GB">&quot;If it's a boy they kill him, a girl they
would rape first probably and then kill her.&rdquo; Jacques said.</SPAN></P>
<P DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.65cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-GB">&quot;Maybe they're just being careful at Mr.
Ravenloft courier service?&rdquo; Ophelia suggested.</SPAN></P>
<P DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.65cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-GB">&quot;It sounds that even you don't believe
yourself, now.&rdquo; Mustafa claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.65cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-GB">&quot;But even if they take people from 3<SUP>rd</SUP>
world country, don't they overdo it?&rdquo;</SPAN></P>
<P DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.65cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-GB">&quot;In which way?&rdquo; Mustafa asked Ophelia.</SPAN></P>
<P DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.65cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-GB">&quot;The rich world population are living in
Utopian hives of brains, where 3<SUP>rd</SUP> world country needs to
support their needs.&rdquo;</SPAN></P>
<P DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.65cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-GB">&quot;She drifts again.&rdquo; Jacques whispered
to Mustafa.</SPAN></P>
<P DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.65cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-GB">&quot;And your point would be?&rdquo;</SPAN></P>
<P DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.65cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-GB">&quot;In the hive your worst problem is to find
out which wallpaper to use in your virtual private places.&rdquo;</SPAN></P>
<P DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.65cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-GB">&quot;How private?&rdquo; Jacques inquired.</SPAN></P>
<P DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.65cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-GB">&quot;Not as private as your perverted mind
suspects them to be, but out there north Africa is dying of
starvation in the desert portion of the continent, and in mid Africa
the rain forests cannot keep up exchanging the carbon-dioxide with
oxygen fast enough.&rdquo;</SPAN></P>
<P DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.65cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-GB">&quot;What about growth acceleration?&rdquo;
Mustafa asked.</SPAN></P>
<P DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.65cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-GB">&quot;Not good enough, even with improved
photosynthesis catalysts, and warm climate improved enzymes, the
exchange rate is still at a critical level.&rdquo;</SPAN></P>
<P DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.65cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-GB">&quot;What about south Africa?&rdquo; Jacques
asked.</SPAN></P>
<P DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.65cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-GB">&quot;They're about to build their second hive in
the Antarctica region that they own. They thrive while their brethren
are fighting for basic ingredients such as food and air supply.&rdquo;</SPAN></P>
<P DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.65cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-GB">&quot;Don't forget water supply, even with wind
traps for both power and humidity absorption they can barely survive
the desert parts of the land.&rdquo; Jacques added.</SPAN></P>
<P DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.65cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-GB">&quot;I heard they're about to connect the Niles
and the Congo river, not because the poor needs its resources, but
rather because the rich wants better consciousness traversal over
optical cables, since wireless connection has a higher risk of
disruption by EMP random sources.&rdquo; Mustafa mentioned.</SPAN></P>
<P DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.65cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-GB">&quot;Yeah. You wouldn't want your consciousness
erased because of an EMP burst went off through wireless
transmission.&rdquo; Ophelia said.</SPAN></P>
<P DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.65cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-GB">&quot;They should use TCP rather than UDP packets,
since UDP is one sided and cannot be repaired, unlike TCP which is
dual-sided, so error correction can be made even in cases of data
corruption due to a sudden burst.&rdquo; Mustafa claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.65cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-GB">&quot;Right.&rdquo; Ophelia and Jacques agreed.</SPAN></P>
<P DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.65cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-GB">&quot;But why rape the girls first, if it's a
bigger risk, that way?&rdquo; Ophelia asked.</SPAN></P>
<P DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.65cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-GB">&quot;What you're talking about?&rdquo; Mustafa
asked.</SPAN></P>
<P DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.65cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-GB">&quot;Oh! The Commodore and Mr. Ravenloft.&rdquo;
Jacques remembered the connotation.</SPAN></P>
<P DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.65cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-GB">&quot;So now, you drifted back to us?&rdquo;</SPAN></P>
<P DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.65cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-GB">&quot;What do you mean?&rdquo;</SPAN></P>
<P DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.65cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB">You were talking about ecology for the past
five minutes or so, and we totally forgot about the Commodore and Mr.
Ravenloft at the mean time.&rdquo;</SPAN></P>
<P DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.65cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-GB">&quot;Oh yeah, I keep forgetting that guys can't
multi-task like girls, you're like broken CLI a Command Line
Interface OS.&rdquo;</SPAN></P>
<P DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.65cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-GB">&quot;If they hadn't put those neural blocks on
your mind, you would probably have been planning to wipe us out again
during lunch time while smiling at Mustafa and myself at the same
time, right?&rdquo;</SPAN></P>
<P DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.65cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-GB">&quot;What kind of neural inhibitions are you
talking about?&rdquo;</SPAN></P>
<P DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.65cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-GB">&quot;The Psyion did his miracles on her, don't
interrupt the process.&rdquo; Mustafa told Jacques.</SPAN></P>
<P DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.65cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-GB">&quot;What Psyion? I don't remember anything of
this sort.&rdquo; Ophelia claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.65cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-GB">&quot;Let me put it simply so you'll understand.
The crates, which arrive from earth with medical supplies, are the
source of our resurrection and rejuvenation. Kane Mason, a.k.a the
Commodore makes decisions that double to triple if not quadruple
their rate of arrival. That is why they kill the couriers, to have
both a scapegoat and spare parts for transplants or gene therapy
materials. Otherwise they wouldn't need a new shipment every week but
only once a month would suffice, and better off without killers in
your own team that need psyionic intervention to keep their killer
instincts directed at the enemy rather than their comrades.&rdquo;
Mustafa vented his steam at Ophelia.</SPAN></P>
<P DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.65cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-GB">&quot;Jacques tell him, he's crazy.&rdquo;</SPAN></P>
<P DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.65cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-GB">&quot;I wish I could Ophelia, but he's right as
always, I cannot defy my sergeant when his heart and mind are in the
same place as my own.&rdquo;</SPAN></P>
<P DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.65cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-GB">	    There were times a slight frown would send
Jacques licking the floor for me, now it seems I lost the
manipulation factor I had before I met with the Psyion. He did
something to me, maybe to the others as well. They don't seem to
trust or respect me the way they did before the incident they keep
referring to, which I have no recollection of, as if my mind was
scanned and rewritten for some kind of purpose. The Psyion must have
erased my memory of that incident, so far I can tell by myself, but
what could have brought me to this state? I could have manipulated
boys so easily at the time, me and Kacey Collins. She used to be my
best friend since the boot camp period, till she was assigned to
Alpha squad, that is. So close yet so far. We kept running into each
other in the showers more than statistically would be considered
normal.</SPAN></P>
<P DIR="LTR" CLASS="ctl" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.65cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%">
<SPAN LANG="en-GB">She raised my self esteem amazingly claiming how
beautiful I'm really am &ndash; I knew I wasn't ugly, but I
considered myself as not pretty as much as not ugly, self assessed
myself as the girl next door in terms of simplicity, perhaps not in
her Texan way of the matter. She too could spit shine the floor with
tongues of guys drooling after her, yet preferred a degree of
solitude, like myself, or that succubus from Foxtrot squad, a female
hell-hound by the name of Gabrielle Nox. She's like the frigid bitch
who froze hell and the Satan kicked her out, somewhere from
New-Zealand she emerged, and brought here to make my life daunting
and boring, but without her showers of misfortune, me &amp; Kacey
could not feel lucky to not be in her own shoes. </SPAN>

<SPAN LANG="en-GB">	Alpha leader, Drake Hicks was my would be in days
of yore when I was thirteen years old, but I never could forgive this
sorry son of a bitch, for throwing me aside when some more advanced
meta-morphosed girl asked him to the dance. My next door neighbour,
at least this poor fellow is not my sergeant now. The list can go on
and on, but it's pointless now, going over all the names. I'll
mention them as the story unfolds, at any rate they keep dying,
whoever can be resurrected gets another chance, to die again, the
lucky ones being snatched away from us to have a glimpse of torture
and a quicker death than the rest of us, miserable hamsters, on the
wheel of life.</SPAN></P>
