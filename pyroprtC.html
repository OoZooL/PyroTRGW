dense than air yet supported acceleration maneuvers of up to 45
G-force factor. The pilots wore pressure suits just in case of a hull
breach decompression. The suits were durable only to 27 G-force
though. Life support came in the form of quad ribbed tubes (two for
the mouth piece and two for the nose piece) which streamed 20% oxygen

tubes with other phyto-plankton which had chloroplasts for
